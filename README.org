  Dracula: It was not by my hand I was once again given flesh. I was
  brought here by humans who wished to be me tribute!

  Richter: Tribute!? You steal men’s souls, and make them your slaves!

  Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions…

  Richter: Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a
  savior such as you!

  Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. But

** What is a yakshave?
   Yakshave is a tool written in Clojurescript (Nodejs) for managing
   and generating [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][leiningen]] projects. It aims to handle the scripting
   tasks that leiningen is currently used for and more.

   Provided that you have nodejs, you can install yakshave with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ npm install yakshave -g
   #+END_SRC

   The latest version is 0.1.2.

   You can also fork it and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ lein cljsbuild once prod
$ npm install -g
   #+END_SRC

** Why should I yakshave?
   It's a lot faster - in the initial release:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ time yakshave new foobar
# yakshave new foobar  0.60s user 0.05s system 96% cpu 0.668 total
$ time lein new bizbar
# lein new bizbar  4.07s user 0.10s system 145% cpu 2.877 total
   #+END_SRC

   Hmm. Like 6 times faster. But remember, those templates are buried
   deep within the leiningen.jar.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ time ys new compojure example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !2804
yakshave new compojure example  0.18s user 0.01s system 101% cpu 0.191 total

$ time lein new compojure example2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       !2841
lein new compojure example2  4.66s user 0.18s system 120% cpu 4.020 total
   #+END_SRC

   For small templates it's almost 26 times faster! Note that the
   compojure template refers to this repository:
   https://github.com/johnwalker/compojure-template

   Aliasing yakshave to ys for finger performance is recommended.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
# in .bashrc / .zshrc
alias ys='yakshave'
   #+END_SRC
** Why shouldn't I yakshave?
   It's not battle-tested. There are probably a lot of bugs, too. Many
   lein templates aren't yet compatible with yakshave. [[http://pages.citebite.com/b2x0j8q1megb][You would have
   to install nodejs.]]
** Complete list of supported tasks
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
yakshave new template-name? project-name
   #+END_SRC
** Usage
*** new - Generating projects
    Yakshave templates -- just like leiningen -- are hosted in maven
    repositories. It is very easy for a leiningen template to be a
    yakshave template, and vice versa. The difference between the two
    is that yakshave templates use edn, while leiningen templates are
    fully programmatic, as they are written in Clojure. Since yakshave
    is brand new, many lein templates will not work yet. If you're the
    author of a template and want some help setting it up for
    yakshave, please open an issue!

    One very important difference is that *yakshave doesn't fetch
    templates yet.*

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    yakshave new foobar
    yakshave new app foobar
    #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Creating yakshave compatible templates
     If you squint, yakshave templates look a lot like leiningen
     ones. Here is what the app template looks like when it's
     described with yakshave:

     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:renderer "app"
 :files [["project.clj" "project.clj"]
         ["README.md" "README.md"]
         ["doc/intro.md" "intro.md"]
         [".gitignore" "gitignore"]
         ["src/{{nested-dirs}}.clj" "core.clj"]
         ["test/{{nested-dirs}}_test.clj" "test.clj"]
         ["LICENSE" "LICENSE"]
         "resources"]
 :data {:raw-name    [:identity]
        :name        [:project-name]
        :namespace   [:sanitize-ns
                      :multi-segment]
        :nested-dirs [:sanitize-ns
                      :multi-segment
                      :name-to-path]
        :year        [:year]}}
     #+END_SRC

     The vector is treated as thread-first on the name the user passes
     to yakshave. If a string were passed instead, then that value
     would merely be substituted. For example, in the "template" template:
     #+BEGIN_SRC  clojure
{:renderer "template"
 :files [["README.md" "README.md"]
         ["project.clj" "project.clj"]
         [".gitignore" "gitignore"]
         ["src/leiningen/new/{{sanitized}}.clj" "temp.clj"]
         ["resources/leiningen/new/{{sanitized}}/foo.clj" "foo.clj"]
         ["LICENSE" "LICENSE"]]
 :data {:name        [:identity]
        :sanitized   [:sanizite]
        :placeholder "{{:sanitized}}"
        :year        [:year]}}
     #+END_SRC

     The valid keys are

     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   :year
   :identity
   :sanitize-ns
   :sanitize
   :multi-segment
   :name-to-path
   :group-name
   :project-name
   :unprefix
     #+END_SRC

     which correspond directly to the built-in leiningen ones. Two new
     keys are :identity and :unprefix. You already know what :identity
     does, and you don't care about :unprefix.
**** List of yakshave compatible templates
     The built-in leiningen templates:

     + app
     + default
     + template
     + plugin

       The compojure fork: https://github.com/johnwalker/compojure-template
**** Template wishlist
     These are some high priority templates for yakshave
     compatibility.

** Contributing
   *Contributors are wanted very badly.* There are many ways to help
   out - porting lein-templates to yakshave, general refactoring,
   writing documentation, blogging about yakshave and contributing
   criticism are all great help.

   Outside of yakshave itself, these are extremely critical:
